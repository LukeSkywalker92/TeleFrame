## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Raspberry Pi only!)

*Electron*, the app wrapper around Teleframe, only supports the Raspberry Pi 2/3/4. The Raspberry Pi 0/1 is currently **not** supported.

Note that you will need to install the lastest full version of Raspbian, **don't use the Lite version**.

Execute the following command on your Raspberry Pi to install TeleFrame:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSkywalker92/TeleFrame/master/tools/install_raspberry.sh)"
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download and install the latest *Node.js* version.
2. If you like to use the voice reply feature you need to install sox
3. Install *Electron* globally with `npm install -g electron`.
4. Clone the repository and check out the master branch: `git clone https://github.com/LukeSkywalker92/TeleFrame.git`
5. Enter the repository: `cd TeleFrame/`
6. Install and run the app with: `npm install && npm start`

Also note that:

- `npm start` does **not** work via SSH. But you can use `DISPLAY=:0 nohup npm start &` instead. \
  This starts the TeleFrame on the remote display.
- To access toolbar menu when in fullscreen mode, hit `ALT` key.
- To toggle the (web) `Developer Tools` from fullscreen mode, use `CTRL-SHIFT-I` or `ALT` and select `View`.

## Configuration

1. Copy `TeleFrame/config/config.js.example` to `TeleFrame/config/config.js`. \
   **Note:** If you used the installer script. This step is already done for you.

2. Modify your required settings.

## Whitelist Chats

When you start your TeleFrame and send a "Hi" to the bot it will send you back the current chat id. Paste this id or several of them into the `whitelistChats` config option to only allow only pictures from these ids (eg `[1234567, 89101010]`). Leave empty (`[]`) for no whitelist.

## Voice Replies using TeleFrame

A very simple way to respond to the images is by using TeleFrame`s voice reply feature. The feature is intended to work like this: Who ever comes by the frame presses a button, speaks their message into the frame, when there is 2 seconds of silence or the maximum time is reached the recording will stop and the telegram bot will send it to the chat where the current image came from.


| **Option**              | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`                   | The keyboardkey to start the voice recording                                              |
| `maxRecordTime`         | How long the recorder will record if there is no silence detected (in milliseconds)       |
| `recordingMessageTitle` | The title of the recording dialog displayed on the frame during record                    |
| `recordingPreMessage`   | The message of the recording dialog displayed on the frame during record before chat name |
| `recordingPostMessage`  | The message of the recording dialog displayed on the frame during record after char name  |
| `recordingDone`         | The message of the recording dialog displayed on the frame when recording has finished    |
| `recordingError`        | The error message of the recording dialog displayed when recording has failed             |

## Touchscreen support
* Navigate through the images by touching at the left or right side of your touchscreen.
* Pause and resume the slideshow by touching in the middle of your touchscreen.
* Record a voice message and reply to the shown image by making a long touch in the middle of your touchscreen. The recording starts when you take your finger off.

## Updating

If you want to update your TeleFrame to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your TeleFrame folder and type the following command:

```bash
git pull && npm install
```

If you changed nothing more than the config, this should work without any problems.
Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, git pull should be possible.

## Bot only mode (no GUI)

To run only the bot (without GUI), that saves the recieved images and videos into the folder specified in the config you need to run

```bash
npm run botonly
```
in the TeleFrame folder.
